Project Name: Animal Crossing: 112 Paradise

Description: Animal Crossing: 112 Paradise is a 112 spin off on Animal Crossing!
Intially when you go into the game, your neighbor Isabelle informs you that
Professor Taylor has graciously built a home for you on the Island.  However,
since he did build your home, you are now indebted to him and have to pay off
100 bells (which Isabelle will collect). You will spend the rest of the 
time trying to pay off your debt and live your life on the island. Some ways to
earn money is selling the flowers you collect in a changing maze and the peach
jam you can make with the peaches in your garden and the sugar you buy from 
Isabelle!

Running the game: The game has 4 files in total, cmu graphics, 112_crossing, 
maze, and bfs. Both maze and bfs are imported into 112_crossing so just 
running 112_crossing with the other files in the same folder will let you play 
the game.
